:revdate: 2019-04-25

- Make the replay control keys configurable.
- Reduce number of loop index variables.
- Fix color of the status bar texts.
- Reorganize the code for speed: move the main game loop to the top.
- Put two mines at two random entries of the nest. The original game
  put one at a fixed entry. Better yet, anywhere inside the nest.
- Put Bill anywhere inside the nest, not always at the center.
- Rewrite the rescue effect.
- Don't delete the status bar when preparing the next level.
- Let the language be changed on during the game.
- Make beep also after a valid key menu.
- Do the saluting also at the end of the replay?
- Make drawing faster by replacing UDG string variables with literal
  strings.
- Display the key in the replay of level 6.
- Add "any other key to return" to instructions and credits.
- Replace flowers with cans, bottles, etc. Increase the score when
  they are collected.
- Decrease score when the flowers are treaded.
