= TO-DO of _Back to the minefield_
:revdate: 2019-03-12

- Make the replay control keys configurable.
- Reduce number of loop index variables.
- Fix color of the status bar texts.
- Reorganize the code for speed: move the main game loop to the top.
- Replace the border effect of `@level_replay` with something better.
- Fix: the color of the top left corner of the fence is wrong at the
  start of the last level.
- Put two mines at two random entries of the nest. The original game
  put one at a fixed entry. Better yet, anywhere inside the nest.
- Put Bill anywhere inside the nest, not always at the center.
- Rewrite the rescue effect.
