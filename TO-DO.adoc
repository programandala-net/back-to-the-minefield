= TO-DO of _Back to the minefield_
:revdate: 2019-03-26

- Make the replay control keys configurable.
- Reduce number of loop index variables.
- Fix color of the status bar texts.
- Reorganize the code for speed: move the main game loop to the top.
- Put two mines at two random entries of the nest. The original game
  put one at a fixed entry. Better yet, anywhere inside the nest.
- Put Bill anywhere inside the nest, not always at the center.
- Rewrite the rescue effect.
- Don't delete the status bar when preparing the next level.
- Let the language be changed on the instructions screen, on the
  credits screen, and also during the game, using the same keys of the
  main menu.
- Reorganize the code so the program can be reentered with `run`
  without reconfiguring the RAM disk, which fails because there's no
  way to check if a file exits, to erase a non-existing file or to
  overwrite an existing file...
- Make beep also after a valid key menu.
- Do the saluting also at the end of the replay?
- Make drawing faster by replacin UDG string variables with literal
  strings.
- Reorganize the languages of the footer menu in columns.
