= TO-DO of _Back to the minefield_
:revdate: 2019-03-25

- Make the replay control keys configurable.
- Reduce number of loop index variables.
- Fix color of the status bar texts.
- Reorganize the code for speed: move the main game loop to the top.
- Fix: the color of the top left corner of the fence is wrong at the
  start of the last level. The problem is attributes are saved from
  address 22561, not not 22560.
- Put two mines at two random entries of the nest. The original game
  put one at a fixed entry. Better yet, anywhere inside the nest.
- Put Bill anywhere inside the nest, not always at the center.
- Rewrite the rescue effect.
- Don't delete the status bar when preparing the next level.
- Let the language be changed on the instructions screen, on the
  credits screen, and also during the game, using the same keys of the
  main menu.
- Reorganize the code so the program can be reentered with `run`
  without reconfiguring the RAM disk, which fails because there's no
  way to check if a file exits, to erase a non-existing file or to
  overwrite an existing file...
